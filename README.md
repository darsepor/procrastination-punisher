**WARNING**: ***DO NOT*** RUN THE MAIN SCRIPT FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH HEADPHONES ON. DON'T TEST CHANGES TO THE NOISE FUNCTION WHILE WEARING HEADPHONES EITHER.

Inspired by https://github.com/jam3scampbell/ProctorAI. Lightweight program for personal use, with a simpler "procrastination sequence" where a mind-breaking noise is played if the user is caught procrastinating. Operant conditioning
